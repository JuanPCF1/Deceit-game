The purpose of this game is for players to do some critical thinking. The way this is achieved is through the stealth aspect of the game. You have to hide behind objects
in order to not get noticed by enemies. You have to wait until they are not looking to get out of cover and continue. If you get caught, there is another change to outsmart
the AI by "Decieving" them. This is done via a conversation with the enemy. If you choose the right answers depending on the enemy's behaviour, you will be able to continue.
Otherwhise, you will be caught and will have to start the level again.

Known Issues:

The only unintentional issue is the following: Once you "Decieve" an enemy, their text is meant to show for 4 seconds so you can read their final reply.
But if another enemy detects you while this is happening, the new enemy's dialogue displays. This is fine, I wanted it thise way BUT it keeps counting down the 4 seconds
before the enemy dialogue is revealed, therefore making the first line of the other enemy dissapear.

Potential future enhancements:

- Lockpicking mechanic for all doors
- Add more than one type of enemy that can visually show his viewing distance
- Add a score system
- Finish the "story"

Thank you for playing my game, I had lots of fun making it.
